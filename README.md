***Description:***
In the King of the Hill (KoTH) challenge, your goal is to compromise the target machine and gain access to the coveted /root/king.txt file on Linux machines or C:\king.txt (or C:\Users\Administrator\king-server\king.txt) on Windows machines. Once you've successfully breached the system, your task is to maintain access and defend the king file from other players.
